            <p>The Automated Four Wheeler Collision Avoidance System is designed to detect obstacles and avoid collisions using a combination of sensors and MM wave radar technology. This project was stimulated using Tinkercad and published in IRCET-2021.</p>
            <p>The system works by constantly scanning the vehicle’s environment for potential obstacles. When an obstacle is detected, the system either alerts the driver or automatically adjusts the vehicle’s path to avoid a collision.</p>
            <p>This project aims to reduce the number of road accidents by incorporating advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in automobiles.</p>
